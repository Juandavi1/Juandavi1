### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

__Juan David here.__ ðŸ”­ I'm currently a Developer at [Siigo](https://www.siigo.com/). In this role, I'm writing tools/libs to ease Developers and SREs  tasks.

I'm Electronic Engineer since 2019 and I'm a physics enthusiast especially in Solid state devices and Astronomy. 

I work with languages like Assembler, VHDL, Java, JS, C# since 2015.   

Cloud technologies are my bag these days; Kubernetes, Istio, Helm, Spark and Kafka. My latest obsession is the Go programming language and distributed systems.
